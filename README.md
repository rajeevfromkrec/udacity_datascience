# Technology is very fast-moving industry and every month new technology and platforms are added. As a new developer it’s very challenging to select which technology, platform and company to select to build career in technology. In this blog I am going to provide answer for three basic questions which every developer has before getting into technology field. This would not only help to new entrant in technology field but also experienced people. Even i had some of these questions while making switch from one company to another company like should I join a smaller company which is paying me a little extra money or should I join a big brand. Please note that the inferences are based on simple assumptions and would help guide you to take decision but in real life there are many variables and every individual’s situation can be different from others so please factor in your individual variability while taking decisions.
