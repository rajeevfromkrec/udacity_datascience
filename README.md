##Which Technology, platform and company to select as a new developer: data driven approach

###Introduction: Technology is very fast-moving industry and every month new technology and platforms are added. As a new developer it’s very challenging to select which technology, platform and company to select to build career in technology. In this blog I am going to provide answer for three basic questions which every developer has before getting into technology field. This would not only help to new entrant in technology field but also experienced people. Even i had some of these questions while making switch from one company to another company like should I join a smaller company which is paying me a little extra money or should I join a big brand. Please note that the inferences are based on simple assumptions and would help guide you to take decision but in real life there are many variables and every individual’s situation can be different from others so please factor in your individual variability while taking decisions.

###Which are popular desired technology to get in:  For this we looked at the data from stack overflow survey. As we can see from below diagram majority of coding population comes from experience range of 0 to 20 years.
 
 
 Then we looked at which are the popular desired technology voted by coder community and plotted top few desired technology on below graph. As we can clearly see Node.JS stands a clear winner here. Also this has been voted by all the different experience range.


 


###Which platform pays better in USA:  Another question which usually is very common among technical people is which platform could pay me better. Again we looked at the survey data for USA and below graph depicts that cloud platform along with IOS and android seems to pay better compared to other platform. This was a free text field so the inference from this field is a little difficult but after removing some of the outliers this seems to be giving closer picture ..


 
###Should I join a big brand or smaller company: To answer this question I tried to look at if there is any co-relation between size of the company and salary offered in average. This revealed a striking co-relation that on a average bigger companies pay better compared to smaller company. Below graph depict the same 

 

###Conclusions:  So now let’s summarize our conclusions
1.	Node.JS is most desired technology and a new starter could have a great career if one can get good experience in node.Js.
2.	Cloud, Android and IOS platforms are good paying platform in general so given a choice one should get into cloud, android or IOS platforms
3.	In general companies with large FTEs pays better than small companies so it would be better choice to start with big companies
